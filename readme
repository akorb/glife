Compile instructions:

make


The visualizing in the report is done with MatLab. I wrote a script called benchmark.sh which creates a MatLab script that plots the results of the benchmark. It requires the source code to be compiled in benchmark mode because there the output of the program is simplified for easier usage in my script.

Benchmark instructions:

make benchmark
./benchmark.sh
